Description: A new generation software for networking labs.
 Eve-NG is a new generation software for networking lab. It can be considered the next major version of iou-web, but the software has been forked from unetlab. The major advantage over GNS3 and iou-web itself is about multi-hypervisor support within a single entity. UNetLab allows to design labs using IOU, Dynamips and QEMU nodes without dealing with multi virtual machines: everything run inside a UNetLab host, and a lab is a single file including all information needed.
